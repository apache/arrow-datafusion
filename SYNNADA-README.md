### Synnada, Inc. Apache Arrow/Datafusion Fork Policy

**Synnada, Inc.** will continue to submit general bug fixes, patches, and other improvements to the **Apache Arrow/Datafusion** project under the Apache 2.0 license. We aim to remain an active contributor to further the growth and maintenance of the core **Apache Arrow/Datafusion** codebase.

However, certain new features developed by **Synnada, Inc.** will be released under our own copyright through this soft fork repository. While we build upon and extend the **Apache Arrow/Datafusion** codebase, new features represent intellectual property that we wish to license separately and maintain copyright over.

This approach allows us to operate at dual levels:

1. Community contributors - Submitting PRs to support the growth and health of the **Apache Arrow/Datafusion** ecosystem through the main project.
2. Independent open source developers - Building proprietary extensions and features on top of **Apache Arrow/Datafusion** that we release under our own terms to customers and the broader OSS community.

Synnada, Inc. believes this model of cooperative development and extension-building enables a thriving ecosystem around **Apache Arrow/Datafusion**. We can continue to support the project's core mission while also driving innovative new features under terms compatible with our business.

We will do our best to keep the **Synnada, Inc.** fork repository interoperable with upstream **Apache Arrow/Datafusion.** Furthermore, we are exploring ways to offer our extensions through transparent licensing in the future so that others can build upon our fork as well. This way, we aim to build a long lasting collaborative partnership between the **Apache Arrow/Datafusion** community and Synnada, Inc.

Please let us know if you have any other questions or require any clarification on our approach to contributing to the **Apache Arrow/Datafusion** project while building proprietary extensions. We are committed to a cohesive partnership that drives open data processing technologies forward.
