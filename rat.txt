                                compatible with -s

NOTE:
Rat is really little more than a grep ATM
Rat is also rather memory hungry ATM
Rat is very basic ATM
Rat highlights possible issues
Rat reports require interpretation
Rat often requires some tuning before it runs well against a project
Rat relies on heuristics: it may miss issues
